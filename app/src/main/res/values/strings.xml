        PkRunner 2020 takes place in the fictional world of System Seven, where human consciousness is
        uploaded into a super computer known as HAL. Most in the digital world are unaware of their
        reality. Pk, the player character, has taken it upon himself to make it to the deepest levels
        of the program in order to destory HAL. In the bottom left screen will be have left and right
        arrows for PK to move left or right and in the right bottom screen will be an up arrow helping
        PK to move up. In addition, I want to thank Mannyboy who develop the game, Otis who made the
        music, and Adrian who design the UI for the game.
